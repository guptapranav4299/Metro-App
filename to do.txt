Basic manipulations:
	
	1. new layout for route wali listView

Graph manipulations:
	
	1. a function, say showOnListView() which takes in an arrayList and spare out all stationName[], stationNode[] and stationColorCode[] from the arrayList. Then using MyAdapter (the custom adapter) showing the output in the route wali listView.
	
	2. adding all the station nodes.
		2.1. Make a list of all stations in text file or anywhere.
		2.2. Make a list of all the stationNames, on various line, use any order (idk why but i prefer line color followed by alphabetical) but in listView use alphabetical order.

	3. How would the graph work???
		3.1. 
			1. Get the node number from route source-destination.
			2. Apply DFS.
			3. Received an ArrayList containing various pathArrayLists.
			4. Decoding path would take time, duh!


UI:
	1. Colored logos
